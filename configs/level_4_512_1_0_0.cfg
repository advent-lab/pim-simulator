#Total number of chips in the system

#Number of tiles in a chip
#tiles in the simulator == core in the pimra terminology
#This is also equal to the number of instruction streams in the system 
#There is 1 controller per core/tile. So, each chip has n_tiles number of controllers.
#This value is calculated as follows:
n_tiles = 2

#Number of blocks in a tile
#This is equal to the number of blocks that can be fed by DRAM at one time
#This value is calculated as follows:
#Number of blocks = wordsize_dram / (n_cols (or n_rows)) (we assume n_cols==n_rows)
#For htree type of connectivity, we want number of blocks in a tile to be a multiple of 4
#assert(n_block%4==0)
n_blocks = 4

#Number of columns and rows in one block of memory (CRAM)
#assert(_ncols==_nrows)

#Bandwidth between various blocks.
#No use of having wordsize_block2block be larger than the number of columns in a RAM
#That's because we can only read 1 row (i.e. number of bits = number of columns in the RAM) at a time
#Meaning, we can only send 1 row at a time from one block to another.
wordsize_block2block = 256

#Bandwidth between various tiles.
#Is there value in having this larger than the row width?
